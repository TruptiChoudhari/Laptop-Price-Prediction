Built a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on specifications like RAM, CPU, GPU, screen size, and storage. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA to identify trends. Applied encoding, scaling, and outlier treatment. Trained and evaluated models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Used GridSearchCV for tuning and selected the best model based on RÂ², MSE, and RMSE. Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.
